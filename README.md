# Medieval Game
## Serialization Project

- Users will focus on creating the core of `MedievalGame.java`
- Most of the other files will be provided, but the user will have to modify them to implement serialization
- User will focus on saving and loading procedures with serialization 
- There is a lot of extra functionality, it is included as a final “challenge” or for the user to download the code into their own IDE and keep working on solutions or expanding the project.

I looked through lessons of beginner and intermediate java so far and incorporated some of those features such as I/O, it just tends to work better when learners can actually culminate all these concepts into something that works.

### Walkthrough Overview

- Review given files
- Add to `Player.java` and discuss extra functionality (to play with post-project)
- Add serialization to object files (`Armour.java` and children, `Weapon.java`, `Player.java`)
- Focus on core `MedievalGame.java` with a focus on serialization and read/write to file

### TODO:

- Minor Refactoring to clean up code
- Add comments to give user more context
