  /* TODO: Additional Functionalities
      - Use Armour methods to reduce/repair armour during combat
      - Add more ASCII art to Art.java
      - Create a Monster class and fight it (an idea would be to refactor Player class
        as Creature and have new Monster and Player classes be subclasses of Creature, so
        some functionality would have to moved to only Player class)
      - Create attack functionality however you like
      - Refactor Player getters/setters for use in attacking vs what they do now, which is
        most for printing / displaying purposes
      - Extended the length of the game / story
